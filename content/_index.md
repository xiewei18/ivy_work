## GLUES üåÑ

GLUES is a Growing project for Land Use Estimation & Simulation.

It `GLUES` together the natural system and the human system.

### Motivation

Land plays an essential role in terrestrial ecosystems as well as human systems. It is central to addressing sustainability issues. How human use, manage and interact with land is the key to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals.

As an essential resource for economic and industrial production, urban land area has been consistently increased all over the world since 1840s as a notable feature of industrial and economic evolution. China is known as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs factory‚Äù and most populated. The pressure on land resources brought by industrial manufacturing and human consumption has promoted expansive and rapid land cover change and related environmental problems within China. Urban land expansion not only causes direct environmental consequences such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, and pollution, but also act as a leverage that causes vast amounts of embodied natural resources consumption through global trade and supply chains.

‚ÄúA human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.‚Äù
